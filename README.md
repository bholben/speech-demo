## speech-demo

The initial app was created from Wes Bos's fun vanilla JavaScript course [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) and then extended to include both speech recognition and speech synthesis

No transpilation, no build process.  Dirt simple vanilla JavaScript.

`git clone git@github.com:bholben/speech-demo.git` and you are good to go!
